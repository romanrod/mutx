How to make documentation for Mutx?
==============

Mutx documentation is loaded to your local mongodb during the command `prepare` from all .md files located inside /mutx/documentation/ 
and /mutx/ folders.
Then it's made available in [/mutx/help/main](/mutx/help/main "Help") where you can see all documents and perform searches through them.

Where do i put the documents?
---------------------

You can push them to the mutx git project inside /mutx/documentation/ folder, /mutx/ folder it's also functional but it's discouraged.

What type of file do i use?
---------------------

You can only use Markdown (.md) files.

How do i name it?
---------------------

The name should describe the content of the document, beware that this name its going to be the title of the document in the [/mutx/help/main](/mutx/help/main "Help") page so take that into consideration.
Also all the name should be all in undercase, and words should be separated by "_" wich are replaced by spaces afterwards.

An example of this:

Name of the file:

	this_is_an_example.md

The the title will be like this:

	This is an example
