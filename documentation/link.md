Share a link to execute a test task
==============

Pressing this button:

<form>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align" ><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star" aria-hidden="true">Link</span></button>
</form>

you will see a message with the url that starts the test task execution with the configured custom params and execution name
This could be helpful when a story is in development process and your test is ready to be executed, so you can create a test task related to the history,
set custom params, execution name and then share the link to the developer which is responsible about the history implementation. Developer will be able to paste the url in the browser and start the execution instantly.
